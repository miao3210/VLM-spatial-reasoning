## How to contribute to scenariogeneration

Do you want to contribute? Awesome!

### Did you find a bug?
Here are some basic first steps to take when finding a bug in scenariogeneration.

- Check your version, scenariogeneration is constantly growing and fixing small bugs, so make sure it haven't been fixed with in a newer version.
- Check if a previous issue has been rased about the same bug. 

#### Creating an issue
If the issue has not been fixed, the raise a [new issue](https://github.com/pyoscx/scenariogeneration/issues/new). Please provide a clear example, either with a code snippet or a txt file (python), where the bug is reproduced, and explain what you expect to happen. 

#### Create a pull request
If you know the issue and already solved it, feel free to create a pull request (aswell as an issue) where the issue is fixed, and link it to the issue. 

#### Think of backwards compability
We strive as much as possible, between release, to keep backward compability. This is not always possible, if larger bugs are found or the API has to change (usually with a new version of OpenSCNEARIO or OpenDRIVE) then API changes will be done. This said, typos and naming convensions of __input variables__ will not be changed easily.


### Do you want a new feature, help, or a generic discussion about scenariogeneration?
Just open an [issue](https://github.com/pyoscx/scenariogeneration/issues/new) and suggest, ask or start your discussion.


Thanks! :)
